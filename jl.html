	<h2>Junior League<h2>
<p>Tenet:Work Ethic<br></p>
<p>Date: Fall 2013<br></p>
<p>Explanation: This was the first time I ever did something for a client. Junior
league is a non-profit organization that benefits the community. One of the benefits that
they give to the community is that they hold an annual "Care Fair" which provides free
medical care to everyone who wouldn't otherwise offord. They had a logo that they didn't like
so they came to us and asked us for a new logo. <br></p>
<p>Reflection: This gave me great work experience. It taught me patience like if a client
reschedules a meeting. It taught me how to present an idea to a client. It also taught
me how to listen to a clients wants and needs. For example, they didn't want it childish, 
so I made it professional. In the end, we got positive feedback, and I really liked
our logo.<br></p>
