<h2>QR Codes<h2>


<p>Tenet:Use of Resources<br></p>
<p>Date: Fall 2012<br></p>
<p>Explanation: This was my first PBL in web. All around the school we have QR Codes
on the teachers door. QR Codes are little barcodes that when scanned reveal information
like a video, or webpage. OUr QR Codes when scanned would take the viewer to a video interview
with the teacher. We used a website to make the bar code, then photoshop and illustrator to 
make the background and the editing. This was for our Open House.<br></p>
<p>Reflection: This was a great introduction to web design. Learning how to make a QR Code
and customizing was really beneficial because not only did it prepare me for another PBL, but
you can use this tool and make it for other people and get compensated. Seeing people actually
scan the codes during Open House made me feel really proud.<br></p>
