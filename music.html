<h2>Music Site<h2>


<p>Professional Presentation<br></p>
<p>Date: Spring 2013<br></p>
<p>Explanation: For my English class, we had to create a website for a music artist's song. 
In the website, we were to talk about the artist, the songs literary elements, and the songs meaning. We
were to present the site to the class. I chose to do Madonna's Like a Prayer. It just really
is a feel good song with a great, uplifting meaning.<br></p>
<p>Reflection:I decided to do something different with my site. This project allowed me 
freedom to experiment and to try new things. One of the first things I did was to have a 
navigation on the bottom to coalesce with the background image.<br></p>
