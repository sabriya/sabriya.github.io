<p>Tenet:Content Knowledge<br></p>
<p>Date: Spring 2012<br></p>
<p>Explanation: This was my first major PBL at SWCTA. What we had to do was teach 
middle school children Photoshop. To help them demonstrate what they learned, we 
created a tutorial for which they had to complete making a digital picture 
frame of themselves.<br></p>
<p>Reflection: Looking back at it, it's hard to believe it was just three years ago
this occurred! Some things that I learned was how to teach someone who isn't technologically 
adept something. I also think it prepared me heavily for the Girls in Tech pbl.<br></p>
